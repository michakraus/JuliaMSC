# Modern Scientific Computing with Julia

This is a book about scientific computing, research software engineering, and parallel computing with Julia.
It is intended for scientists of all disciplines developing research software.
While many examples are inspired by the implementation of numerical algorithms for the solution of differential equations, the book also covers many generic topics such as software sustainability and test-driven development.

## Prerequisites

All examples in the book are tested with Julia v1.10, but they should run with any Julia version from v1.6 and up.

To build the book, installation of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the [Julia Color Extension for Quarto](https://gitea.math.uni-leipzig.de/hellmund/julia-color) is required.
This repository contains a slightly modified version of the Julia Color Extension that improves the visibility of Julia output in LaTeX files.
