# Modern Scientific Computing with Julia

This is a book about scientific computing, research software engineering, and parallel computing with Julia.
It is intended for scientists of all disciplines developing research software.
While many examples are inspired by the implementation of numerical algorithms for the solution of differential equations, the book also covers many generic topics such as software sustainability and test-driven development.
